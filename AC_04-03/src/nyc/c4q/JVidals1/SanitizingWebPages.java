 * 2.1 Accesscode
 * HW Exercises
 * Description:
 * Due April 3
 *
 * Task: Search engines like Google have programs called web-scapers which visit webpages and scrape the information
 * displayed on the webpage. The displayable information is contained in html tags like p, table, h2 etc.
 * When we make a GET request for a webpage, the HTML that is returned can also contain tags like script which often
 * do not correspond to the displayable content on the webpage. Information inside script tags is not used by scapers
 * and they often ignore these tags in the HTML. Write a class called WebPageSanitizer which implements a static method
 * called String sanitize(String html) which removes all script tags and the information that they encapsulate and returns
 * a sanitized version of the HTML string.
