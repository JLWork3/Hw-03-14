      Tips for Understanding your code…


This week at Access Code, I had a difficult time understanding why my
programs were not running properly. I would stare at the computer screen
for hours reviewing each line of code but frustration would set in and I
would raise a white flag of surrender. I would ask my fellow classmates
and TAs for assistance and I would hope they would help me see the flaw…

/A:/ I have two young daughters.

Charlotte, my one-year-old, is just learning to talk. She repeats
everything she hears. She doesn’t quite have the sounds exactly right
yet, but she’s getting close. I know that “bata” means “bottle” and “kee

      Pair Programming

Every day I go to Access Code, I get excited to see who I would sit with
to pair program with. At school, I would normally sit in one specific
seat throughout the entire year. At C4Q, however, I move around and
change where I sit for the day’s class unless it was already assigned.
Hence, each day became a new experience for me as I’ve been able to pair
with many of my…

      Fried Brain


With more time consuming projects being assigned in school and the
homeworks assigned in Access Code <http://c4q.nyc/accesscode> becoming
increasingly difficult, I find myself spending more time marathon coding
before my night class. I thought this was fine until I realized that my
brain was literally fried by the time I got to Access Code at 7pm during
that day.

    Finding A Mentor

/Q: I’ve never worked under an experienced creative director, and feel
like my work has never been skillfully critiqued. How can I find a
decent mentor?/

      Best Practices to Tackle Problems

If you are learning to code, there are techniques that you can apply in
the process. Here are some tips that helped me when trying to solve
programming problems.

*Read the question*

When trying to tacking a problem, read the task out loud. This helps
when trying to understand what is expected for the task.

*Pseudo Code!*

Write pseudo code. This step comes before you begin to code. This is a
great technique for beginners because you are writing in complete
sentences. It’s a great way to outline the task. In a notebook, write
out the steps , the variables that you need, and your plan of action.

*Draw a diagram*

By drawing a diagram, you can visually see how you organize your
concepts and how you may be able to tackle the problem.

*Communicate*

This step can be intimidating but it helps. When review your code with
another person, you are will start to understand more the tactics you
used to solve the task.

*Ask Questions*

Don’t be afraid to ask questions, even when you think you understand a
concept. It’s okay if you do not understand it on the first or 20 th
try. Ask questions until it starts making sense.

*Sharing is Caring*

Do not be afraid to share your work with friends, family, mentors,
teachers, or other cool programmers. You will be amazed how much you can
learn from positive feedback.
